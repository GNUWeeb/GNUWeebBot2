GNU/Weeb Telegram Bot (2)
=========================

Hi,

As promised previously, this is the initial git tree for the new GNU/Weeb
Telegram bot project. I encourage everyone to contribute to this project. I am
looking forward to your contribution.

I call it GNUWeebBot2. It's the second attempt to create a Telegram bot
project for the GNU/Weeb community; the former GNUWeebBot doesn't perform
really well. This one will be the better version of it.

Currently, this project only runs on Linux.

## LICENSE

In the spirit of the open-source community, this project is fully open-source.
This project is licensed under GPLv2 (which is my default license choice).

## Directory Structures

  1. modules/ - this is where bot modules are stored, something like bot
  commands, welcome messages, etc. (relevant to the bot response and pluggable
  bot behavior).

  2. core/ - contains the core bot code. It contains the entry point, event
  loop, ring, etc. This part is the most complex part of the project. Be
  careful when touching this code. Take care of your mental health; it can
  make you crazy.

  3. include/ - contains header files that need to get included across
  multiple subsystems.

  4. lib/ - contains library code, like telegram API, string helpers, curl,
  etc.

  5. tests/ - contains unit tests code. Currently, it's not much comfortable
  to make a new test. You can skip this part at the moment.


## The MAINTAINERS file

The template comes from the Linux kernel MAINTAINERS file. If someone adds a
new module, please maintain it. Put your name and email into this file.


## Build Tools

- gcc or clang (just one of them)

- g++ or clang++ (just one of them)

- make

- sh (for ./configure)

For Ubuntu: sudo apt install clang make gcc g++ -y

Please adapt the build tools installation if you use other Linux distros.
